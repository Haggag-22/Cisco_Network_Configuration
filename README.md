## Project Overview
The network is built with multiple Cisco devices, employing best practices and industry standards. It integrates various technologies to ensure seamless communication, security, and efficient resource management across different network segments.

## Key Features and Configurations

- **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP):** Implemented to prevent network loops and ensure a reliable and stable network topology.
- **Network Address Translation (NAT):** Configured for secure communication between internal and external networks.
- **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP):** Automated IP address assignment for efficient device management.
- **Voice over IP (VoIP):** Integrated VoIP services for internal and external telecommunication.
- **Domain Name System (DNS):** Setup for hostname resolution and domain management.
- **VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) & Trunking:** Centralized management of VLANs across multiple switches, ensuring efficient network segmentation.
- **Virtual LANs (VLANs):** Segmented the network into multiple logical networks to enhance security and performance.
- **EtherChannel:** Configured for link aggregation to increase bandwidth and provide redundancy.
- **Demilitarized Zone (DMZ):** Securely hosted public-facing services while protecting the internal network.
- **Internet Service Provider (ISP) Simulation:** Simulated an external ISP to enable realistic external connectivity.
- **Web Server Hosting:** Configured web servers for hosting internal and external web pages.

## Network Topology
The project includes a multi-layer network topology, featuring core, distribution, and access layers, with each layer designed to provide optimal performance and scalability.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Cisco Packet Tracer:** Used for network simulation and configuration.
- **Cisco Routers and Switches:** Configured various Cisco devices to simulate a real-world network environment.
- **Custom Web Pages:** Hosted on internal web servers to provide accessible resources within the network.

## Use Cases
- Simulates a corporate network with multiple departments and external connectivity.
- Demonstrates advanced network features and configurations for educational and professional purposes.
- Serves as a reference for designing secure and efficient network architectures.
